Observation 1:
Observation Statement: Most users do not actively search for the cheapest gas, relying on convenience over price tracking.

Supporting Data: 55.6% of respondents indicated they "don’t actively look for the cheapest gas," while only 8.9% use gas price tracking apps, and 28.9% check prices while driving.

Team Action (if any): Design the app to integrate passive tracking features, such as background notifications or automated alerts, to appeal to users who don’t actively search for gas prices.

Observation 2:
Observation Statement: Users want a smart gas price tracker that factors in distance, fuel efficiency, and real-time prices to find the best deal.

Supporting Data:
Users don’t want to drive too far just to save a few cents.
Many suggest AI-driven comparisons based on MPG, distance, and price.
Some need multi-car profiles for tracking different fuel types.

Team Action (if any):
Develop an AI-powered recommendation system.
Add multi-car profiles for customized alerts.
Use real-time traffic data to refine price-to-distance estimates.
