Observation 1:
Observation Statement: Most users do not actively search for the cheapest gas, relying on convenience over price tracking.

Supporting Data: 55.6% of respondents indicated they "don’t actively look for the cheapest gas," while only 8.9% use gas price tracking apps, and 28.9% check prices while driving.

Team Action (if any): Design the app to integrate passive tracking features, such as background notifications or automated alerts, to appeal to users who don’t actively search for gas prices.
