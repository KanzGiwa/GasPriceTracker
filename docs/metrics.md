## Explain how to collect the data for the specific metric in the backend
* Metric 1 (NPS) - Collect the net promoter score from a servay 
* Metric 2 (Adoption)- Collect the registration rate of new users.
* Metric 3 (DAU) - Collect the data from Firebase analytics 
* Metric 4 (Retention) - Collect the number of logins per week. 
* Metric 5 (CTR) - Click through rate for users clicking the 'search' button in order to search for stations after they have specified their radius
* Metric 6 (Specific to our app) - We will track how often users click the "Open in Maps" button to find directions to their nearest affordable gas station. This custom metric, opening_maps, will be implemented in Firebase. Each time a user presses the button, an event will be triggered to increment this metric, allowing us to monitor engagement and usage of this feature within our app.
